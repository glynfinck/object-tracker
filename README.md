# MistyWest-SensorBot
## UBC Engineering Physics Capstone Project, Sponsored by [MistyWest](https://www.mistywest.com/)

#### Project Objective:

Demonstrate the effectiveness of new edge-computing platforms by creating an autonomous robot that takes advantage of machine vision and machine learning hardware acceleration to perform an interesting and interactive demonstration of exciting technologies (e.g. environment sensing, neural networks for object sensing and path planning, etc).

Based on the [NVIDIA Jetson Nano](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit) computing platform.
